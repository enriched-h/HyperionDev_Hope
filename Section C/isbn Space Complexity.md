The worst-case space complexity of the ISBNJava app can be analyzed based on the usage of additional data structures and variables during 
its execution. Here's an overview of the space complexity for different components of the app:

Input String and Cleaned ISBN: The input ISBN string and the cleaned ISBN string are stored as variables in memory. 
The space required for these strings is proportional to the length of the input ISBN string, which can be considered as O(N), where N is the 
length of the string.


Integer Variables: The app utilizes integer variables to store various digits, sums, and checksums during the ISBN validation and conversion process.
The space required for these variables is constant and can be considered as O(1).


ISBN-13 String: If the provided ISBN is valid and needs to be converted to ISBN-13, a new ISBN-13 string is generated by appending the 
necessary digits to the cleaned ISBN. The space required for the ISBN-13 string is proportional to the length of the cleaned ISBN string, 
which can be considered as O(N), where N is the length of the string.


Checksum Calculation: During the ISBN-13 checksum calculation, a checksum variable is used to accumulate the sum of the products of digits.
The space required for this variable is constant and can be considered as O(1).

Overall, the dominant factor affecting the space complexity is the length of the input ISBN string. Therefore, the worst-case space 
complexity of the ISBNJava app can be expressed as O(N), where N is the length of the input ISBN string.
